Expected Questions & How to Answer

Q: "How would you optimize this C++ code for performance?"

    Discuss cache locality, avoiding copies, using move semantics, SIMD

    Show profiling mindset: measure first, then optimize bottlenecks

Q: "Compare Rust and C++ approaches to memory safety"

    Rust: Compile-time guarantees via borrow checker

    C++: RAII, smart pointers, but requires discipline

    Mention that C++26 might get lifetime annotations proposal

Q: "You need to expose a C++ library to Rust via FFI. What are the challenges?"

    Data type conversions

    Exception safety (C++ exceptions can't cross FFI boundary – must use error codes)

    Memory ownership protocols

    Thread safety assumptions

Q: "How would you implement a thread-safe singleton in C++?"

    Show Meyer's singleton (C++11 thread-safe static local)

    Discuss double-checked locking pitfalls

    Mention std::call_once
